I'm Joe. I try to spend time learning new technologies and skills, since otherwise I'll be 
spending all my time reading classical literature and history books until my skill set is as ancient.

Not much here is going to be particularly finished or polished, but I try to push up things that I worked 
on when learning or practicing outside of work.
